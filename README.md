# Tutorials

If you are a beginner, you may want to start with some very basic 
tutorials that explain why `git` and `GitHub` are the tools that you want 
to know.

- As usual in a computing world, the best place to start is 
the [Hello World project](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) (10 min) 

    This tutorial covers some basic concepts about `GitHub` - all without
    ever leaving your browser. 
    
    See if you can
    explain the following terms after going through the tutorial:
    - what is a __repository__?
    - what is a __branch__?
        - what is the name of the _default branch_?
    - what is a __commit__?
        - what is the point of a _commit message_? 
    - what is a __pull request__?
        - what do the _diffs_ show? 
        - what does it mean to _merge_ a pull request? 

- [Got 15 minutes and want to learn Git?](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) - let the Octocat guide you through
some basic Git command line tools. (And if you are new to command line, don't worry! this one is in a browser window!) 

- [What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) - very non-tech explanation of the major ideas behind using distributed version control system for running a project  

- [Introduction â€¢ GitHub & Git Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyfwLX4HAxM) - basic material, but uses a lot of jargon that may be tricky to follow if you have never used version control before 

- [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) - the title says it all; and it comes with a [cheatsheet](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf) 
        
- Now that you know the basics ...
    - [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)  
    - [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) - this is a great tutorial on `Git`, and it is nice to know that GitHub is not the only kid on the block 
    - `git help` - this is the instruction (enter it on a command line) that displays information about all of the different git commands
